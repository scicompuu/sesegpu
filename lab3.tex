\title{Lab 3 on Wednesday}

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}{General lab procedure}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item I will be in Zoom room and discuss your questions on usage of GPUs, the pre-lab 2 and help you with lab 3
  \item You do not have to stay in the Zoom room all the time
  \item I will try to notice you on Slack if we are going to discuss something
    of interest to many people
  \item Feel free to work on the lab outside the scheduled hours
  \item We have a reservation on Wednesday -- Friday, as announced in the
    Slack channel
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It will only worked within the announced hours, do not use
      it outside the scheduled hours as your jobs will not run!
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Lab 3: Conway's Game of Life}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Solved on a regular $n \times m$ grid of cells
  \item Each cell has 8 neighbors (including diagonals)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each cell can take two values, \code{1/True} or \code{0/False}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Live cell: value 1
      \item Dead cell: value 0
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Evolution from iteration $i-1$ to iteration $i$ defined by current state and neighbors
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives
    \item All other live cells die
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Less than 2 neighbors: underpopulation
      \item More than 3 neighbors: overpopulation
      \end{itemize}
    \item Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell
    \item All other dead cells stay dead
    \end{itemize}
  \item All rules are evaluated based on number of live or dead neighbors in
    previous iteration step $i-1$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Na\"ive algorithm for Conway's Game of Life}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compute number of live neighbors to each cell on a fixed grid
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Possibly with extra term for current cell alive/dead
    \end{itemize}
  \item Apply rule based on live/dead status and number of live neighbors

  \item Represent operation as a convolution
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Read up on syntax for convolution with TensorFlow
    \end{itemize}
  \item Repeat for $N$ generations
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Background}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Our algorithm is not an \emph{efficient} way to solve problem
  \item Hashlife: Use fact that Game of Life is fully deterministic
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If a certain patch is identical to some patch seen before, evolution of patch can be predicted
    \item With some caveats of course
    \end{itemize}
  \item We represent state as floating point numbers -- could use narrower, more efficient format
  \item Data locality from one iteration to next?
  \item We will not look into this
